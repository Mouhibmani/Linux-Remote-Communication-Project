# Remote Communication Project

Explore remote communication using this simple client-server project. The project includes a server program that communicates with remote clients, providing various functionalities based on client choices. It utilizes C programming, sockets, and pthreads to create a robust communication system. Dive into the code, compile and run your server, and experiment with remote interactions. An excellent learning resource for network programming and client-server architecture.

## Project Structure
- `Client.c`: Client program for remote communication.
- `Ser.c`: Server program handling client requests.
- `S.h`: Header file with shared constants and utility functions.
- `script.sh`: Script for compiling and linking client and server programs.
